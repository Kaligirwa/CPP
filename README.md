Practice the basics


1) BASICS/QUICKSORT
- creates an array of random numbers between 0 and size of the array 
- sorts the array recursively by partitioning it in smaller and smaller subarrays 
- to compile: sh compile.sh
- to run: ./a.out <size of array> 

2) BASICS/HEAPSORT
- creates an array of random numbers between 0 and size of the array
- sorts the array using a heap, repeatedly removing the largest element on top 
- and re-heaping the remaining array

- to compile: sh compile.sh 
- to run: ./a.out <size of array> 

3) BASICS/BINARYSEARCH 
- find an element in an array of random elements
- sort the array first 
- divide the array in smaller partition till the element is found or not

- to compile:  sh compile.sh
- to run: ./a.out <size of array> <element to find>
